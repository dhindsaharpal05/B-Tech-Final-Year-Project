# B-Tech-Final-Year-Project
India, a nation steeped in history and tradition, is losing its heritage sites fast.
Monuments and paintings, are strong reminders of the many identities and
histories that form the collective consciousness and becomes an inalienable part
of us. Some forms of threat to heritage monuments can be lack of awareness about
the culture, misguidance by people, tampered boards, etc.
The system focuses on the importance of using modern technologies in preserving
and exploring Cultural Heritage . Augmented Reality (AR) has the
potential to enhance the user's experience when visiting places with cultural heritage.
